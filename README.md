# Systems Design Laboratory course (2023/2024) @ UniVR #

This repository contains the collection of code and slides on BDDs for the Systems Design Laboratory course (2023/2024). It refers to laboratory lectures from the *representation of formal models for systems* part of the course.

## Lecture 01: The CUDD package ##

CUDD stands for **C**olorado **U**niversity **D**ecision **D**iagram. It is a package for the manipulation of Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs), Algebraic Decision Diagrams (ADDs) and Zero-suppressed Binary Decision Diagrams (ZDDs).

In particular, in the `lecture_01/` folder, you can find:
* `add_mat/`: The folder that contains additional material for further study;
* `code/`: The folder that contains the solution source codes of the assigned exercises;
* `cudd-2.4.2.tar.gz`: The CUDD package release 2.4.2;
* `cudd-2.5.0.tar.gz`: The CUDD package release 2.5.0;
* `cudd-2.5.1.tar.gz`: The CUDD package release 2.5.1;
* `cudd-3.0.0.tar.gz`: The CUDD package release 3.0.0;
* `slides/`: The lecture slides.

## Lecture 02: The HermesBDD package ##
**HermesBDD** is a parallel multi-core and multi-platform package of Binary Decision Diagrams, written in C++ and fully developed at the University of Verona. It focuses on high performance, usability, and correctness. For more information, compatibility lists, details, and more, please visit the HermesBDD [home page](https://luigicapogrosso.github.io/HermesBDD/).

In particular, in the `lecture_02/` folder, you can find:
* `add_mat/`: The folder that contains additional material for further study;
* `slides/`: The lecture slides.
